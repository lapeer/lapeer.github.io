					why is outreach important?
				</h1>
				<br>
				<h2 style="font-family: IMFell; text-align: left;">
					involvement in scientific outreach is an incredibily important aspect of being a scientist. 
					outreach is the process of connecting with the general public (i.e., mostly non-scientists) and educating 
					them about scientific practice, research, and more. connecting with a more general audience like this 
					provides wonderful opportunities for people to learn about the coolness of science, gain a better understanding 
					of the world they live in, and maybe even inspire people to become scientists themselves. i love participating in outreach and 
					view it as one of my core responsibilities that come with being a scientist. if you're interested in discussing 
					specific opportunities or just want to chat about science communication, please reach out to me from my 
					<a href="contact.html">contact page</a>!

							astrobites is an international collaboration of graduate students in astronomy/related sciences 
						who aim to communicate new astrophysical science through bite-sized articles covering the latest and greatest

							<li>during my time as an undergraduate i held a part time math/physics/comp. sci. tutoring position at 
								<a href="washtenaw community college">washtenaw community college</a> (wcc). in my last 
								year i started a program called `astronomy monthly' which aimed to get more community college students involved in astronomy
								and educate people about pursuing careers as professional astronomers. the program ran for a full academic year with 
								variable results, but the people involved loved it! we stargazed, did programming activities, and more!

						<ul>
							<li>
								the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/sas/">student astronomical society</a> astronomical society (`sas' for short)
								at the university of michigan hosted regular public observing nights. using the telescopes owned by the university (including a pretty hefty 0.4m aperture cassegrain 
								which was situated in a motorized dome) we encouraged members of the public to come and look through the telescopes, ask questions, 
								and even partake in a little astrophotography! i was one of the 0.4m telescope operators for these events, running the 
								telescope system and talking to folks about the objects we observed.
