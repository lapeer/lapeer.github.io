                i picked up web design as a hobby mid-2024. since then, i have increasingly made an 
                effort to center my online presence around my website. instead of social media, i now share 
                things about myself here, in a realm of my own creation. i like to share my interests, artwork, 
                thoughts, ideas, and research here! do note that this website is ever changing, i update it 
                semi-regularly, and some of the pages may be under construction. 
            </p>

                this site is hosted on my github, but my neocities page also redirects here. my domain is a reference to <em>giant molecular clouds</em>, which are complexes of cold
                molecular gas, and the primary site of star formation in the local universe. if you cannot tell, 
                my career is a big part of my life, and i enjoy theming things around it. all of the code you see her is written 
                by me, unless stated otherwise. i <b>do not support the use of generative AI</b>; all code on this site 
                is written by humans. the template for this site was originally from the wonderful <a href="https://ribo.zone/">ribo.zone</a>. i have made some major 
                changes, but the bones are still there!
