				if you're here, it must mean you want to learn more about me! that's okay, i don't mind when people are nosy! 
				in case you didn't notice, my name is drew! i am the owner of this website, and an individual who contains multitudes. 
				i'm currently pursuing a ph.d. in astrophysics, which is what takes up most of my time. i love my job, 
				but a lot of this website is dedicated to my professional life, so i'll refrain from too much discussion about 
				it here. 
				<br>
				<br>
				i'm originally from rural michigan. i love my midwestern roots, and have been told that i come off as a 
				very sterotypical, aggressively kind midwestern. i currently live in the wonderland that is western massachusetts, the first and only 
				time i've lived outside of michigan. before my ph.d., i revieved a bachelors of science in astrophysics from the university 
				of michigan, and before that was a student doing my general studies at macomb community college. 
				<br>
				<br>
				i have lots of opinions and thoughts on just about everything, but i'll refrain from discussing most of them
				here. my main hobbies include reading (check out the reading page on my site!), music (mostly listening, also check out my music page!), hiking, 
				rock climbing, and occasionaly gaming. i also love art, especially oil paintings and poetry. i am a lover of vintage clothing, especially 
				t-shirts, and spend a ton of time combing thrift stores and antique shops. 
				<br>
				<br>
				most of my interests are displayed in one way or another on this website. feel free to poke around, learn more about me, or don't.
