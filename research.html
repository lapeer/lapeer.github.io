			<ul>
				<li>university of michigan (2022-2024), advised by professor <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/astro/people/core-faculty/mvalluri.html"> monica vlluri</a>
					<ul>
						<li>worked broadly in the field of <em>galactic dynamics</em>, which broadly applies a theoretical framework based on the dynamics of stars and gas to astrophysical observations and models.</li>
						<li>i worked with something called <em>schwarzschild modeling</em>, which aims to take kinematic observations of galaxies and derive galaxy traits from those observations using models.
						i utilized the method for the sake of constraining supermassive black hole masses based on the motions of stars near a galaxy's central region. i worked closely with dr. <a href="https://behzadtahmaseb.github.io/">behzad tahmasebsadeh</a>
					on probing what sorts of supermassive black holes the james webb space telescope could detect. you can find the publication on that work <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6a1b">here.</a></li>

			<h1>current research</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>university of massachusetts amherst (2024 - present), advsed by professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniela_Calzetti">daniela calzetti</a></li>
				<ul>
					<li>i am broadly working in the field of <em>stellar feedback</em>. stars can impact not only their surrondings, but also the entire galactic ecosystem through something called <em>stellar feedback</em>. this feedback comes in two flavors: 
						pre-supernova feedback, in the form of stellar winds, photoionization, and radiation pressure, or supernova feedback, produced by the death of stars.</li>
					<li>this work is being done as part of the FEAST project, which aims to probe stellar feedback from the youngest star clusters with the james webb space telescope. 
						i am aiming to characterize emerging young star clusters, clusters which are still emergy from the clouds they were born in. understanding these objects is important for 
						a variety of reasons, such as better understanding the star formation cycle, the interplay between galaxies and their stars, and the escape of ionizing photons from galaxies.
